            <h1>Motor Bikes</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>A motorcycle, often called a <span> motorbike, bike, cycle, or (if three-wheeled) trike, is a two- or
                    three-wheeled</span>
                motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes:
                long-distance
                travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a
                motorcycle
                and being involved in other related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending
                motorcycle
                rallies.</p>
            <p>In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were<span> Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both
                    from
                    Japan),
                    and Hero MotoCorp (India)</span>.[6] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian
                due to
                lower
                prices and greater fuel economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and
                Southern
                and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.

            <h3>Types</h3>
            <p>The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see § Legal definitions
                and
                restrictions).

                There are three major types of motorcycle: <span>street, off-road, and dual purpose</span>. Within these
                types, there
                are
                many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each type,
                such
                as
                road racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt bikes.

                <span> Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types</span>.
                Off-road
                motorcycles
                include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal
                in
                most
                areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to
                make
                them
                legal and comfortable on the street as well.

                Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a
                different
                riding posture.

                In some countries the use of pillions (rear seats) is restricted.

            <h3>Experimentation and invention</h3>
            <p>
                The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen. It was designed
                and
                built
                by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany, in 1885.[8] This
                vehicle
                was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees
                of
                steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle
                dynamics
                developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while
                turning.[9]
            </p>
            <p><span>The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5⁄8
                    hp
                    (0.47
                    kW)</span>,
                40 cc (2.4 cu in) displacement, 2+1⁄4 in × 5 in (57 mm × 127 mm) bore × stroke, flat twin four-stroke
                engine
                (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed
                carburettor
                (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, all of which were state of the art at the time.
                Starting
                was
                by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was
                controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by
                raising
                and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then
                borne by
                two
                small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as
                Butler
                failed to find sufficient financial backing.[14]

                Many authorities have excluded steam powered, electric motorcycles or diesel-powered two-wheelers from
                the
                definition of a 'motorcycle', and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world's first
                motorcycle.[15][16][17]
                Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide,[18] defining only internal-combustion
                powered
                two-wheelers as 'motorcycles' is increasingly problematic. The first (petroleum fueled)
                internal-combustion
                motorcycles, like the German Reitwagen, were, however, also the first practical motorcycles.[16][19][20]

                If a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first motorcycles
                built
                seem
                to be the <span>French Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede </span>which patent application was filled in
                December
                1868,[10][11]
                constructed around the same time as the American Roper steam velocipede, built by Sylvester H. Roper
                Roxbury,
                Massachusetts.[10][11] who demonstrated his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern U.S. in
                1867,[8]
                Roper
                built about 10 steam cars and cycles from the 1860s until his death in 1896.[17]

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p><span>Motorcycles have a higher rate of fatal accidents than automobiles or trucks and buses. United
                    States
                    Department
                    of Transportation data for 2005 from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System show that for passenger
                    cars</span>,
                18.62
                fatal crashes occur per 100,000 registered vehicles. For motorcycles this figure is higher at 75.19 per
                100,000
                registered vehicles – four times higher than for cars.[54] The same data shows that 1.56 fatalities
                occur
                per
                100 million vehicle miles travelled for passenger cars, whereas for motorcycles the figure is 43.47
                which is
                28
                times higher than for cars (37 times more deaths per mile travelled in 2007).[7] Furthermore, for
                motorcycles
                the accident rates have increased significantly since the end of the 1990s, while the rates have dropped
                for
                passenger cars.

                The most common configuration of motorcycle accidents in the United States is when a motorist pulls out
                or
                turns
                in front of a motorcyclist, violating their right-of-way.[55] This is sometimes called a SMIDSY, an
                acronym
                formed from the motorists' common response of "Sorry mate, I didn't see you".[56] Motorcyclists can
                anticipate
                and avoid some of these crashes with proper training, increasing their visibility to other traffic,
                keeping
                to
                the speed limits, and not consuming alcohol or other drugs before riding.[57]

                The United Kingdom has several organisations dedicated to improving motorcycle safety by providing
                advanced
                rider training beyond what is necessary to pass the basic motorcycle licence test. These include the
                Institute
                of Advanced Motorists (IAM) and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA). Along with
                increased
                personal safety, riders with these advanced qualifications may benefit from reduced insurance costs[58]
